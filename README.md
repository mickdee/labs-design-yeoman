# Labs Design Yeoman

A custom [Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) project tailored to Labs Designers. 

## Getting Started

After cloning, run `bower install` and `npm install` to get started. 

## Build & development

Run `grunt serve` for local development, and `grunt build` for a final build.

## Pushing to CF

To enable password protection of your prototype, update `Staticfile.auth` with credentials generated by [this Htpasswd tool](http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/). Default is user:admin/pw:admin

To push your app to CF, navigate to the `/dist` folder and use the CF command line interface: `cf push name-of-my-app -m 64M -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack.git`  

Or use the `Makefile` by typing `make` into your console (change the app name)

Otherwise, update `manifest.yml` with the name of your Cloud Foundry app and run `cf push` from ANY folder for easy deployment.  

## Setup
Run `./setup.sh` to remove the Git remote & check to see if you have node & grunt installed  
If you do not have permissions to run `./setup.sh` -- run `sh setup.sh` or set executable permission via `chmod +x file.sh`
